CS375 Assignment 5

The program will run on the hardcoded edges.
The program will construct an MST using Kruskal's algorithm and then print out the 
separate groups of the graphs.

Then the program will identify what the points are and print out
the points, and also print out how many points are in each graph.
To run make the file by typing make, and then run by typing
./submission

The file will run only for the hardcoded edges.
There is a nested for loop to identify the connected edges,
so there is an O(n^2) time complexity.

Attempt at Extra Credit
Incomplete, but I thought that the algorithm was correct.
It had small modifications to Dijkstra's algorithm.
It makes with make, and runs with ./extracredit
I don't quite understand why for the value 0 (a) the INT_MAX value is printed.

But I would have figured out the min distance value from d to a, then a to i.
Then I would use the vector<int> path to store the 
path taken to get to node a and then i to track the shortest path.
